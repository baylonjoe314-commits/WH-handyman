## üß∞ Project Structure
```
/assets           # logo + vector placeholders

styles.css        # styling (dark + gold brand)
script.js         # smooth scroll, mobile nav, helpers

## üöÄ Deploying with GitHub Pages
GitHub Actions now publishes the site for you whenever you push to `main`.

1. Push your latest changes to the `main` branch (or merge a pull request).
2. In **Settings ‚Üí Pages**, set the source to **GitHub Actions** the first time you enable Pages.
3. The `Deploy static site` workflow will build and deploy your files ‚Äî wait for the green checkmark.
4. Copy the **Live** URL from the workflow run or from *Settings ‚Üí Pages* and update the badge link above (replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`).

**Custom domain (optional):** In *Settings ‚Üí Pages*, add your domain (for example, `workinghandsconstruction.com`) and follow the DNS instructions.

### üåê Configure `workinghandsreno.com`
Follow these steps if you want the site to live at `https://workinghandsreno.com`.

1. Open **Settings ‚Üí Pages** and enter `workinghandsreno.com` in the **Custom domain** field. Click **Save** and ensure **Enforce HTTPS** remains checked after GitHub verifies the domain.
2. Add (or confirm) the `CNAME` file in the repository root so Pages knows your domain:
   ```bash
   echo "workinghandsreno.com" > CNAME
   ```
   Commit and push the change so the workflow redeploys with the domain file.
3. Update your DNS provider with the GitHub Pages records:
   - **A records for the apex (`workinghandsreno.com`):**
     - `185.199.108.153`
     - `185.199.109.153`
     - `185.199.110.153`
     - `185.199.111.153`
   - **CNAME for `www.workinghandsreno.com`:** point to `<your-github-username>.github.io`
4. Wait for DNS to propagate (it can take up to 24 hours) and rerun the deployment if prompted. Once the green checkmark appears in the latest **Deploy static site** workflow, visit both `https://workinghandsreno.com` and `https://www.workinghandsreno.com` to confirm HTTPS is active.
